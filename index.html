    <h1><b>Why Erfan is in Canada ?</b></h1>
    <h2><b>What is my goal and what is my motivation ?</b></h2>
    <p>Hello, <br>
    Hope you are all doing well,<br> 
    My name is <mark><b>Erfan</b></mark> and I am so excited to be here and study in a completely new situation, etc... <br>
    I decided to come to Canada about <em>one year ago</em> and although I wasn't expecting it to happen too early after one year I found myself struggling with lots of new circumstances! <br> 
    I live in <i>Vancouver</i> with my mother and my little sister and my little sister is the reason I am now writing this at the university! <br> 
    For now, my goal is to keep studying so I can my bachelor's in IT and find a good job and study along with it <small>(I actually like studying and typing about it, otherwise there would be no reason to write such a long paragraph !!!)</small> <br> 
    And I really like one <i> quote </i>, which I think to most of the time, which is <em><strong>"How Big Would You Dream? If You Knew, You Couldn't Fail ?!"</strong></em> <br>
And these are <b>three</b> of my favorite courses : 
    </p>
<ul> 
<li><i>Scripting For IT</i> </li>
<li><a href="https://learn.bcit.ca/d2l/home/914252" target="_blank"><i>Fundemantal Web Technologies</i></a></li> 
<li><i>Intro to System Administration</i></li>
<!-- I really like them equally that is why I don't put them in <ol> :)  -->
</ul>

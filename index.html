            I live in <i>Vancouver</i> with my mother and my little sister and my
            little sister is the reason I am now writing this at the university!
          </div>
          For now, my goal is to keep studying so I can my bachelor's in IT and
          find a good job and study along with it
          <small>(I actually like studying and typing about it, otherwise there would
            be no reason to write such a long paragraph !!!)</small>
          <div>
            And I really like one <i> quote </i>, which I think to most of the
            time, which is
            <em><strong>"How Big Would You Dream? If You Knew, You Couldn't Fail
                ?!"</strong></em>

<h1>Why Erfan is in Canada ?  </h1>
<h2>What is  the goal of Erfan and what is my motivation ?  </h2>
<p>Hello, <br>
Hope you all doing well . <br> 
My name is Erfan and I am so excited to be here and study in a completely new situation and etc... <br>
I decided to come to Canada about one year ago and altough I wasn't expecting to happen too early but after one year I found myself struglling with lots of new circumistances ! <br> 
I live in Vancouver with my mother and my little sister and that my little sister is the reason I am now writing this in the university! <br> 
For now my goal is to keep studying so I can my bachler in IT and find a good job and study along with it (I acctually like studying and typing about it, otherwise there would be no reason to write such a long paragraph !!!) <br> 
And I really like one qoute, which I think to most of the times, which is "How Big Would You Dream, If You Know, You Couldn't Fail ?!" <br>
And these are three of my favorite courses : 
<ul> 
<li>Scripting For IT </li>
<li><a href="https://learn.bcit.ca/d2l/home/914252">Fundemental Web Technologies</a> </li> 
<li>Intro to System Administration</li>
<!-- I really like them equally that is why I don't put them in <ol> :)  -->
</ul>

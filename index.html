<h1><b>Why Erfan is in Canada ?  </b></h1>
<h2><b>What is the goal of Erfan and what is my motivation ?  </b></h2>
<p>Hello, <br>
Hope you all doing well, <br> 
My name is <mark><b>Erfan</b></mark> and I am so excited to be here and study in a completely new situation and etc... <br>
I decided to come to Canada about <em>one year ago</em> and altough I wasn't expecting to happen too early but after one year I found myself struglling with lots of new circumistances ! <br> 
I live in <i>Vancouver</i> with my mother and my little sister and that my little sister is the reason I am now writing this in the university! <br> 
For now my goal is to keep studying so I can my bachler in IT and find a good job and study along with it (I acctually like studying and typing about it, otherwise there would be no reason to write such a long paragraph !!!) <br> 
And I really like one <sub>qoute</sub>, which I think to most of the times, which is <em><strong>"How Big Would You Dream?, If You Know, You Couldn't Fail ?!"</strong></em> <br>
And these are <b>three</b> of my favorite courses : 
<ul> 
<li><i>Scripting For IT</i> </li>
<li><a href="https://learn.bcit.ca/d2l/home/914252"><i>Fundemental Web Technologies</i></a></li> 
<li><i>Intro to System Administration</i></li>
<!-- I really like them equally that is why I don't put them in <ol> :)  -->
</ul>

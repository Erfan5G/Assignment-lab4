                Hello, <br/>
                Hope you are all doing well,<br/>
                My name is <mark><b>Erfan</b></mark> and I am so excited to be here
                and study in a completely new situation, etc... <br/>
                I decided to come to Canada about <em>one year ago</em> and although I
                wasn't expecting it to happen too early after one year I found myself
                struggling with lots of new circumstances! <br/>
                I live in <i>Vancouver</i> with my mother and my little sister and my
                little sister is the reason I am now writing this at the university!
                <br/>
                For now, my goal is to keep studying so I can my bachelor's in IT and
                find a good job and study along with it
                <small>(I actually like studying and typing about it, otherwise there
                    would be no reason to write such a long paragraph !!!)</small>
                <br/>
                And I really like one <i> quote </i>, which I think to most of the
                time, which is
                <em><strong>"How Big Would You Dream? If You Knew, You Couldn't Fail
                        ?!"</strong></em>
                <br/>
            </p>
        </article>

        And these are <b>three</b> of my favorite courses :

        <ul>
            <li><i>Scripting For IT</i></li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://learn.bcit.ca/d2l/home/914252" target="_blank"><i>Fundemantal Web Technologies</i></a>
            </li>
            <li><i>Intro to System Administration</i></li>
            <!-- I really like them equally that is why I don't put them in <ol> :)  -->
        </ul>

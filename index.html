        <p>
          Hello, <br />
          Hope you are all doing well,<br />
          My name is <mark><b>Erfan</b></mark> and I am so excited to be here
          and study in a completely new situation, etc... <br />
          I decided to come to Canada about <em>one year ago</em> and although I
          wasn't expecting it to happen too early after one year I found myself
          struggling with lots of new circumstances! <br />
          I live in <i>Vancouver</i> with my mother and my little sister and my
          little sister is the reason I am now writing this at the university!
          <br />
          For now, my goal is to keep studying so I can my bachelor's in IT and
          find a good job and study along with it
          <small
            >(I actually like studying and typing about it, otherwise there
            would be no reason to write such a long paragraph !!!)</small
          >
          <br />
          And I really like one <i> quote </i>, which I think to most of the
          time, which is
          <em
            ><strong
              >"How Big Would You Dream? If You Knew, You Couldn't Fail
              ?!"</strong
            ></em
          >
